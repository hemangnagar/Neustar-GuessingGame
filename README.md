# Neustar-GuessingGame

This is a number guessing game created as part of the Neustar interview process.

The game is deployed at http://h-gg.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.

This app is created using AngularJS and the unit tests are written to utilize the Karma-Jasmine unit testing framework of AngularJS. 

Please note that before running the unit tests you will need to install karma and angular-mock libraries. 
A good tutorial to configure karma for unit tests is here : https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/testing-angular-with-karma

The karma.config.js file that is a part of this commit is used to run the unit tests.
